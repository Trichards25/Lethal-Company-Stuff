# Just a modpack for my friends 

# This modpack has custom configs with it IT WILL OVERWRITE YOUR CONFIGS

I tried to add in a mix of quality of life improvements and new mechanics that I think are fun and interesting

Also a few really bad memes and sound effects

### Things this modpack has:

-HD mod

-New tools

-New scrap

-Late game upgrades/ skill point system

-Key binds for things like flashlight, walkies, and switching radar while on the terminal

-Better scan/ seeing total amount on ship and in hand

-Dynamic quota

-New enemies/ mechanics you have to fight against and work around

-New suits

-Bad memes

-And much more

I tried to only add mods that add to the game and don't make it overly difficult or easy

## This is just for fun and just meant for my friends

Most of the time the modpack probably will not work right or will be glitchy. I am sorry I am trying my best to make everything work together

At one point I hope to add custom mods but probably much later down the line

I hope to constantly add in new mods and would love any suggestions

### This is just a collection of mods I don't have any preconfigured configs

### Also this modpack is kinda hard so goodluck
